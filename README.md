# CS50's AI Projects 

This repository contains my projects from **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python, offered by Harvard University**. Through this course, I explored foundational concepts in AI and implemented practical solutions using Python. Each project showcases key AI topics such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and more.

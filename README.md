# CS50's AI Projects 

This repository contains my projects from **CS50's Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python From Harverd** , where I explored concepts in AI and implemented practical solutions using Python. Each project demonstrates key AI concepts such as search algorithms, knowledge representation, machine learning, and more.
